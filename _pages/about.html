The Leigh lab opened its doors in 2020! The overarching goal of the lab is to understand the factors that allow for highly regenerative species to perform remarkable acts of regeneration (e.g. limb regeneration), with a particular focus on how the immune system promotes and permits complex regeneration. We are excited to tackle this question using salamanders as a model system and applying a variety of wet-lab techniques coupled with high throughput computional approaches. In addition, we are interested in tool generation to enable us to ask our questions of choice. We are also big promoters of open science and are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and creative team!  </p>
