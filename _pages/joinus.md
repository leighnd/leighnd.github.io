## Current opening(s):
<p> We are currently recruiting a postdoc! See <a href="https://www.med.lu.se/content/download/144815/943029/file/Announcement%20Post%20doc%20scholarship%20in%20Regenerative%20Immunology.pdf"> here</a> for more information. Please see below about ideal candidates. We are fully committed to ensuring an open, honest, and inclusive work enviroment and top priority will be given to candidates who are committed to these values. </p>

## Affiliations:
<p>Graduate students will be part of the <a href="https://www.medicine.lu.se/research/postgraduate-research-studies-0">graduate school at Lund University</a>. The lab is looking for members who are excited about applying wet lab and/or computional approaches to study the intersection of regeneration and immunology. The lab is a collaborative and supportive team in a fantastic environment at <a href="https://www.medicine.lu.se/contact/biomedical-centre">Lund University Faculty of Medicine</a> in the <a href="https://www.medicine.lu.se/about-the-faculty-the-departments/departments/department-of-laboratory-medicine/research-divisions">Department of Laboratory Medicine</a> within the division of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy. We are also part of the <a href="https://www.wcmm.lu.se/wallenberg-centre-for-molecular-medicine">Wallenberg Centre for Molecular Medicine Lund</a> and the <a href="https://www.stemcellcenter.lu.se/lund-stem-cell-center">Lund Stem Cell Center</a> Please get in touch with Nick via <a href = "mailto: nicholas.leigh@med.lu.se">email</a> if you are interested in talking about joining the lab. </p>

## Ideal Candidates:
All members of the lab are expected to be kind, honest, open-minded, and industrious. This does not mean working 24 hours a day or not taking vacation. This means coming to lab and being a supportive and kind lab mate, giving and taking advice, being open to others' ideas and cultures, and overall being respectful and as helpful as possible. In addition, people who enjoy optimizing how the lab functions, how we interact, and overall want to come in each day and try and make the lab a better place are highly desired. We firmly believe that being happy leads to better work and that working as a team is more fun, efficient, and leads to more reproducible and better quality science than working alone. We also greatly value diversity and want everyone to strive to make the work enviroment as inclusive to everyone regardless of their race, age, color, disability, faith, ancestry, national origin, citizenship, sex, sexual orientation, economic class, ethnicity, gender identity, or gender expression.


## Current projects:
You can find individual projects below, while we expect one person to be in the driver seat of their project all of these projects will overlap and be collaborative. 

1. We are looking for a trainee with an interest in the innate immune system and how it contributes to salamander limb regeneration. This trainee will have the opportunity to work with salamanders and pioneer techniques that allow for the investigation of the requirements for innate immune cells during regeneration. This is an great position for someone interested in regeneration or immunology. It would be awesome if person had training in immunology or developmental biology, but this is not required and candidates with experience in other fields are welcome to get in touch. Experience with single-cell RNA sequencing, FACS/MACS, cell culture, and experience working with animals (e.g. injections) is a plus. If you haven't worked with aquatic species or salamander in particular please still get in touch, we are happy to train you! 

2. This project is focused on the adaptive immune system and the interactions between adaptive immune cells and the progenitor cells required for regeneration. While we know there are adaptive immune cells in and around the tissue and cells undergoing regeneration we lack an undersatnding of how adaptive immune cells are influencing this process. Previous work understanding T or B cell function, vaccine design, antigen presentation, or haematopoietic transplantations would be fanastic, but again not required. As above, previous experience with salamanders is not required. 

3. This project is a tag team effort between a computionally- and wet lab-based trainees. Beginning to tease out how cell type function compare across species is of importance in trying to determine why some species have better regenerative ability than others. This project is computationally focused and is aimed at examining cell type orthologies across species. The computional aspects of this project could hypothetically be done remotely and if your situation does not allow you to come to Lund/Sweden we could arrange, for example, a remote postdoc. Prior skills in analysing data from single-cell 'omics technologies would be highly preferable. In addition, an understanding of comparative genomics would be a bonus. As stated above, these projects would be collaborative and a wet-lab counterpart would also work on this project, taking findings from our computational work and working on in vitro and in vivo systems.

We have other projects in the works and are always happy to hear from people interested in joining the lab and for them to pitch any ideas that would be interested to explore using the salamander model system!
